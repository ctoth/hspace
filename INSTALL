asaHSpace 5.0 Millennium Editiion Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for using HSpace 5.0, this version of HSpace has been
re-built from the ground up using true object oriented coding with
speed and expandability in mind.  HS5 uses minimal information from
the MUSH and stores all space related data locally instead of on
objects.

We have provided all the tools you will need in the form of @commands
and functions within the MUSH so that you may customize the look and
feel of HSpace and tailor the players experience to your liking.

HSpace 5 is currently compatible with the following builds:
PennMUSH 1.8.3p9+

If you would like to work on the HSpace 5 project and help us create
the links for other platforms/versions please get in touch with us.

Now on to the installation.
